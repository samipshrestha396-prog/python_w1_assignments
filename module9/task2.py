# Extend the program by adding an accelerate method into the new class.
# The method should receive the change of speed (km/h) as a parameter.
# If the change is negative, the car reduces speed.
# The method must change the value of the speed property of the object.
# The speed of the car must stay below the set maximum and cannot be less than zero.
# Extend the main program so that the speed of the car is first increased by +30 km/h, then +70 km/h and finally +50 km/h.
# Then print out the current speed of the car. Finally,
# use the emergency brake by forcing a -200 km/h change on the speed and then print out the final speed.
# The travelled distance does not have to be updated yet.
